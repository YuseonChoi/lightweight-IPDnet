# A Lightweight Direct-Path IPD Estimation Model for Real-Time Multiple Moving Sound Source Localization
## üîç Overview
- This study proposes a lightweight LSTM-based neural network for localizing multiple moving sources in noisy and reverberant environment
- A full-band and narrow-band fusion network is adopted as the backbone netowrk, which has recently emerged as a prominant research trend. 
<br>


## üí° Motivation
- The backbone network requires high computational complexity as each individual narrow-band layer must processes full time frames across every frequency bin, resulting in substantial computational burden.
- While the parameter size in a deep-learning model primarily affects memory usage, the actual inference time and energy consumption are more significantly influenced by computational complexity.
- Reducing computational load enhances execution speed and reduces power consumption, making the model more suitable for mobile and embedded environments.
- Therefore, this work focuses on minimizing computational complexity rather than simply reducing parameter size.

## ‚≠ê Method
![Model Architecture](imgs/Models.png)
- To improve computational efficiency, the model incorporates down-sampling blocks composed of convolutional layers. These progressively compress the temporal dimension while extracting compact feature representations.
- The original skip connection method based on concatenation is replaced with summation to further reduce computation.

<p>Table 1.„Ö£Performance comparison between the baseline and the lightweight model on the simulation dataset.</p>

- Experiments show that the proposed model reduces computational cost by up to 51% compared to the baseline, while achieving comparable localization performance in terms of Gross Accuracy and Fine Error.
- The results confirm that the proposed model maintains reliable localization performance even in low-resource environments.
